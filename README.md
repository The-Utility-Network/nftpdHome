## 📜 Overview

**NFTPD** (Non-Fungible Token Protocol Daemon) is the reference implementation and documentation hub for the **Onchain Blacklist Protocol**—a decentralized security infrastructure designed to redefine wallet identity and asset protection in the web3 era.

This repository serves as the **Protocol Explorer**, a high-performance web application built to host the living whitepaper, technical specifications, and the philosophical foundations of our work.

## 📖 Key Modules

### [1. The Protocol Whitepaper](/src/app/documents)
Located at `/documents`, this interactive reader details the technical specifications of the Onchain Blacklist Protocol.
-   **Chain Agnostic Security**: A universal standard for wallet blacklisting.
-   **Wallet-as-Identity**: Shifting the paradigm from address-based to NFT-based identity.
-   **Living Document**: Continuously updated to reflect the evolving threat landscape.

### [2. The Creative Revolution](/src/app/our-model)
Located at `/our-model`, this module presents "The Creative Revolution"—a philosophical treatise in nine parts. It explores the foundations of autonomous creation, collective flourishing, and the architecture of a new world, integrated with identifying wallet structures.
